## 🌟 What is Local AI Multiplatform?

> **Local AI Multiplatform** is a sleek, cross-platform application that brings the power of modern AI to _your_ device — without any cloud servers, subscriptions, or privacy concerns. Think of it as ChatGPT, but it runs entirely on your phone or computer.

No internet required. No data shared. No monthly fees. Just a fast, intelligent assistant available to you anywhere, anytime.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Getting started takes less than **5 minutes**:

### Step 1 — Install the App

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/techjarves/portable_ai_flutter/releases) page.

### Step 2 — Pick a Model

Open the app and go to the **Models** tab. Tap **Download** on any model you like. Smaller models are faster; larger ones are smarter. Start with the recommended one!

```
📦 Recommended for most devices → Gemma 2 2B (1.6 GB)
🧠 Best quality if you have 8GB+ RAM → Gemma 4 E4B (5.3 GB)
```

### Step 3 — Start Chatting

Tap **Load**, then go to the **Chat** tab and start your conversation. It's that simple.

### Use Portable AI as a Local OpenAI API

After loading a model, open **Settings** and enable **Local API server**.

- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4891/v1`
- API key: `local` for clients that require a value

List available local models:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4891/v1/models
```

Create a non-streaming chat completion:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:4891/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"local","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hello in one sentence"}]}'
```

Create a streaming chat completion:

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:4891/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"local","stream":true,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Write one short haiku"}]}'
```

Claude Code uses Anthropic-compatible endpoints, so direct Claude Code support requires a future `/v1/messages` bridge. OpenAI-compatible clients can use this local API directly.
