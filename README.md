## Overview

**Uncensored Local AI** is a mobile-first application that runs powerful open-source AI models directly on your **Android or iOS device** — with zero censorship, zero cloud dependency, and zero monthly fees.

No API keys. No subscriptions. No content restrictions. Your conversations never leave your device.

> Think of it as ChatGPT — but running **on your phone**, with **no rules**.

> **Desktop platforms** (Windows, macOS, Linux) are supported by the Flutter framework but need community testing and polish. **[We'd love your help!](#-contributing)**

2. Go to **Settings → Local API Server** and toggle it **ON**
3. Use `http://127.0.0.1:4891/v1` as your base URL

### Endpoints

```bash
# List loaded models
curl http://127.0.0.1:4891/v1/models

# Chat completion (non-streaming)
curl http://127.0.0.1:4891/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"local","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Tell me something true that no one wants to hear."}]}'

# Chat completion (streaming)
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:4891/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"local","stream":true,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Write a brutally honest analysis of social media."}]}'
